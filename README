This repo contains some scraping scripts to retrieve [Destiny Tracker Events](http://destinytracker.com/destiny/events)

Additionally, it contains a module with [Helga](http://helga.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) plugins to output this information to IRC.

Currently, the commands consist of:

* nightfall - Returns name and modifiers on the current week's nightfall strike. (scraped from destinyplanet.com)
* heroic - Returns name and modifiers on the current week's heroic strike. (scraped from destinyplanet.com)
* daily - Returns name and modifiers on the current week's story mission (scraped from destinytracker.com)
* xur - Returns a URL for a www.vg247.com page that lists Xur's location and inventory.
